<p>2k19 is a game created by the company 2k who also create all the other 2k games . Such as wrestling and others. But there most popular game series is NBA2k . The series first started in 1999 with the game NBA2k. 
    Alot of people love these games and really good , but there is alot of things wrong with them. When you type in codes for the "MyTeam" they don't work . But 2k are usually fixing these problems the next day . 
This is a great game to play against your friends , you could black 1 on 1 on blacktop or just play a regular game . You could make your own player in "MyCareer" , and play against other people players on the park .  </p>
